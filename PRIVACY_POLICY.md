# Privacy Policy for Athena Mill

Last updated: 28/4/2025

## Introduction

BECO VENTURES PTE. LTD. ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Athena Mill mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

## Permissions and Data Collection

### Camera Permission

The app requires camera permission (android.permission.CAMERA) to:

- Take photos during inspections of manufacturing equipment and facilities
- Document safety issues such as broken machinery, hazardous conditions, or compliance violations
- Capture critical failures like equipment malfunctions or structural damage
- Upload visual evidence for detailed inspection reports and maintenance records

When you use the camera feature in Athena Mill, each photo is tagged with relevant metadata (such as location, timestamp, and inspection category) to create comprehensive documentation. For example, when documenting a machine failure, your photo will be directly linked to that specific equipment's maintenance history, allowing maintenance teams to quickly assess the issue and implement repairs.

These photos are:

- Stored securely on our servers using AES-256 encryption
- Used only for inspection documentation, compliance verification, and maintenance planning
- Accessible only to authorized personnel within your organization's permission structure
- Deleted when no longer needed for business purposes (typically after 3 years or as specified by your organization's data retention policy)

### Microphone Permission

The app requires microphone permission to:

- Record audio notes during equipment inspections
- Document verbal descriptions of machinery conditions and issues
- Record ambient sound levels for equipment performance analysis
- Capture voice memos for maintenance reports

For example, when inspecting a conveyor system, inspectors can record audio notes describing specific wear patterns or unusual sounds from bearings, which helps maintenance teams diagnose issues more accurately. Audio recordings are:

- Encrypted and stored securely alongside related inspection data
- Used only for inspection documentation and maintenance planning
- Accessible only to authorized maintenance personnel
- Automatically deleted after 3 years or as per your organization's retention policy

### Storage and Security

- All photos and data are encrypted during transmission
- We use secure cloud storage solutions
- Access to data is restricted to authorized personnel only
- Regular security audits are performed

### Data Sharing

We do not share your photos or personal data with third parties except:

- When required by law
- With your explicit consent
- With authorized personnel within your organization

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access your data
- Request deletion of your data
- Opt-out of certain data collection
- Request data correction

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
